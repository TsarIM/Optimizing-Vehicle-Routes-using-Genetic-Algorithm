# Optimizing-Vehicle-Routing-using-Genetic-Algorithm
Applied a Genetic Algorithm to the well-known Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to optimize vehicle routes. The goal was to minimize the total distance traveled while ensuring no vehicle travels significantly more than the others, thereby maintaining a balance in route distribution.
